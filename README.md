- <b>osTicket (Help Desk Ticketing System)</b>
  - [osTicket: Prerequisites and Installation](https://github.com/iamfern88/osticket-prereqs)
    
     ~ osTicket is an open-source help desk system that runs on a standard web server like Apache or Nginx, using PHP and a MySQL or MariaDB database to manage tickets. To install it, you simply upload the files to your server, set up a database, adjust a few permissions, and follow the step-by-step web setup to get everything up and running.
    
  - [osTicket: Post-Installation Configuration](https://github.com/iamfern88/post-install-config)
    
     ~After installing osTicket, the post-installation configuration is where you fine-tune the system to match your organization’s needs. This includes setting up departments, configuring email settings, creating help topics, adding staff accounts, and adjusting system preferences to ensure tickets are routed and managed efficiently.
    
  - [osTicket: Ticket Lifecycle Examples](https://github.com/iamfern88/ticket-lifecycle)
    
     ~osTicket’s ticket lifecycle shows how a support request moves from creation to resolution within the system. A ticket is submitted by a user, assigned to the appropriate department or agent, updated as communication continues, and finally resolved and closed once the issue has been addressed.
        
- <b>Microsoft Azure</b>
  - [Configuring Active Directory within Azure VMs](https://github.com/iamfern88/configure-ad)
    
     ~Configuring Active Directory within Azure VMs involves setting up a Windows Server virtual machine in Microsoft Azure and promoting it to a domain controller to manage users, computers, and policies. Once configured, you can join other Azure VMs to the domain, apply Group Policy, and centrally manage authentication and access across your cloud-based network.
        
  - [Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Network Protocols](https://github.com/iamfern88/azure-network-protocols)
    
     ~Network Security Groups (NSGs) in Azure act like virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for your virtual machines and subnets. By configuring NSG rules and monitoring traffic, you can filter specific ports and protocols while inspecting network activity to better understand and secure communication within your environment.
